You are the commander of the Earth Starship 
ESS Maiden. The galaxy is under attack by the 
invading SNOHTYP's. Your mission obviously is 
to detroy their ships and save the galaxy.

You can select one of 3 ships for your mission:

Battleship: Ponderous, heavily armed and lots 
of power, but a bit slower than the others.
Cruiser:    Quicker then the battleship, but 
not as heavily armed and shielded.
Scout:      Fast, lightly armed. Designed for 
hit and run tactics

The galaxy is mapped into an 8 by 8 grid of 
64 quadrants. Each quadrant is subdivided into 
an 8 by 8 grid of 64 sectors. These are numbered 
0-7 down and 0-7 across. A specific sector can 
therefore be located by a 4 digit number 
(2 quadrant and 2 sector).For example 3265 would 
in be in quadrant 32 (row 3, column 2 of the 
long range scan). And 65 would be the sector 
(row 6, column 5 of the short range scan.

You start the game with a fully supplied starship.
Eventually you will use up your torpedo load 
and/or your energy supply.  You will need to dock 
at a starbase and get your ship fully loaded.

Unfortunately, due to a glitch in your computer,
you don't know how many starbases you have, or 
where they are located. So, finding these should 
be high on your list of tasks. Note that a 
starbase has huge shields, and if you are docked 
with a starbase, you will be protected from enemy 
fire.

There is no limit on how many stardates you have 
to finish the game.  Your efficiency rating it 
partially dependent upon how many stardates it 
takes you to defeat all the enemy. 
Galaxy intelligence has learned that the enemy is 
planning a second, even bigger swarm. GI has an 
estimated stardate for this, but it is only an 
estimate, so they suggest you do not cut it too 
close. You can still survive the swarm, but there 
will be a LOT of enemy gunning for you.

The enemy moves at approximately warp 4. So, step 
lively when you move.  Some enemy will run away, 
some will try to follow you and overwelm your 
shields.

Black holes are abnormalities in space-time. If 
your ship lands on one of these, you will 
immediately be transported to a different 
location in the galaxy. Exactly where is 
something the scientists haven't figured out 
how to predict. Black holes can only be 
detected by a short range scan.

You have two types of weapons.
A photon torpedo is a powerful weapon. If it hits an 
enemy, it will destroy them.  Unfortunately, your ship 
only has a limited number available and you will need 
to dock with a starbase to replenish your supply.
A phaser uses your energy supply to project a beam at 
the enemy. If the beam hits with enough energy, it will 
destroy the enemy. Otherwise, it will simply decrease 
their shields. You may need to fire more than once at an 
enemy to overcome their shields.

You have the following command available:
Short:  Perform a short range scan showing the contents
of the current quadrant
Long:   Perform a long range showing the quadrants around
your current quadrant, and the results of previous long 
range scans. NOTE, the previous long range scans are not 
updated automatically.  It is possible that enemy ships may 
have moved in or out since you scanned the quadrant.
Move:   Move to a new quadrant:sector
Photon: Fire a photon torpedo at an enemy.  Note that photon
torpedoes are NOT smart enough to dodge a star or a black hole.
Phaser: Fire a phaser at an enemy.
Shields:Set power to your shields (power to the shields is
taken from your total power available).
Tracker:Launch a tracker to track the movement of an 
enemy ship. The tracker will report the location of the 
enemy ship no matter where you are in the galaxy.
Clear:  Clear the results of all your previous long range
scans. Useful when you have scanned all the galaxy and some 
enemy ships have moved (or the enemy has swarmed and the 
previous enemy locations have changed.)
